# User Stories

## As a person who has indecisive friends, I want to easily create polls that my friends can access so we can make democratic decisions within our friend group

## I want the choices to have a title, and optionally a description

## I want the poll to only be available to the people I have chosen to include via email.


## I want my group to know all of the available options and have descriptions available for the options I have provided, and have them laid out convieniently in one place. 

## I want to have my friends ranked choices evaluated in a fair way (ranked choice voting vs. first past the post)

## As the creator of a poll, I expect to have an administrative link for myself, and a shareable link to allow friends to vote on the poll

## I want my friends to be able to enter in a poll ID on the homepage and be redirected to the poll that I created, or to be able to click the emailed link, and be taken straight there. 

## I want my friends visiting the shared link to be able to vote only once they have given a name.

## I want to be notified each time someone responds to the poll, and be given a link to view the results

## As someone responding to a poll, I want to be able to rank my options, so that even if my first option is not the most popular, I am still having my voice heard in some way.
